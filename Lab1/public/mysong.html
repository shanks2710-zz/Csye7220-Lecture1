Lying in my bed, I hear the clock tick and think of you<br>
Caught up in circles, confusion is nothing new<br>
Flashback, warm nights almost left behind<br>
Suitcases of memories, time after...<br>
<br>
Sometimes you picture me, I'm walking too far ahead<br>
You're calling to me, I can't hear what you've said<br>
Then you say, &quot;Go slow&quot;, I fall behind<br>
The second hand unwinds<br>
<br>
If you're lost, you can look and you will find me<br>
Time after time<br>
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting<br>
Time after time<br>
<br>
If you're lost, you can look and you will find me<br>
Time after time<br>
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting<br>
Time after time<br>
<br>
After my picture fades and darkness has turned to gray<br>
Watching through windows, you're wondering if I'm OK<br>
Secrets stolen from deep inside<br>
The drum beats out of time<br>
<br>
If you're lost, you can look and you will find me<br>
Time after time<br>
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting<br>
Time after time<br>
<br>
You said, &quot;Go slow&quot;, I fall behind<br>
The second hand unwinds<br>
<br>
If you're lost, you can look and you will find me<br>
Time after time<br>
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting<br>
Time after time<br>
<br>
If you're lost, you can look and you will find me<br>
Time after time<br>
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting<br>
Time after time<br>
<br>
Time after time<br>
Time after time<br>
Time after time<br>
Time after time<br>
Time after time<br>
Time after time<br>
Time after<br>
Time after
